Your response goes here!

* i learned more about how to search effectively to find exactly what you're looking for
* it was basic html so i find everything quick easy to learn and udaicty did really good job to explaning all the stuff so well. 
* for me personally it was difficult to being consistant. but i'm working on it and with time and my effeort now i'm more consistant then before
* i kinda love when i find any error or any random probelm shows up. i read the error do the quick search and figure out what needs to be done then write a quick note how i'm gonna tackle this specific problem and start working towards it. i think i'll able to answer more specifally and in deep when javascript challenges will start.
